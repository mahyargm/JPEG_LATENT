This code is based on the official JPEG AI software and additionally saves the latent image representations after entropy decoding.

By running wrapper.py, you can launch multiple parallel instances of JPEG AI to process an entire directory of images efficiently. The script automatically splits the dataset into chunks and processes them in parallel across multiple workers.

Optionally, the outputs generated for each chunk can be merged back into a single directory using merge_chunks.py.

**Note:** To turn off the bitrate matcher change ""!include": ["AE/default.json", "BRM/regen_list.json"]," to ""!include": ["AE/default.json", "BRM/default.json"]," in "cfg/pipeline.json".



# JPEG-AI Reference software

This software package is the reference software for Rec. ITU-T T.840.1 | ISO/IEC 6048-1 JPEG AI learning-based image coding system (JPEG-AI). The reference software includes both encoder and decoder functionality.
Reference software is useful in aiding users of a image coding standard to establish and test conformance and interoperability, and to educate users and demonstrate the capabilities of the standard. For these purposes, this software is provided as an aid for the study and implementation of JPEG-AI.
The software has been jointly developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG, Question 6 of ITU-T Study Group 16) and Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 29, Coding of audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia information.
A software manual, which contains usage instructions, can be found in the "docs" subdirectory of this software package.
The source code is stored in a Git repository. The most recent version can be retrieved using the following commands:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/wg1/jpeg-ai/jpeg-ai-reference-software.git
cd jpeg-ai-reference-software
```

## System requirments
1. Ubuntu Linux 18.04 or later
2. CUDA 10.2+ or CUDA 11.3+.
2. List of packages (you may run `make setup_system` to install them):
    - doxygen 1.8.13
    - graphviz 2.40.1
    - git-lfs 3.0.2

## Setup Environment

1. Install reuirments:
    - On Ubuntu PC.
        Install [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) and setup an environment by a command: `make configure`.
    
    - Docker container.
        To get Docker container run a command: `make run_docker`.

2. Build C++ libraries for testing: `make build_test_libs`.

## Evaluation of the reconstruction task

Evaluation over all images in the dataset:

```
activate jpeg_ai_vm
make test
```
the results will be stored to a directory `results/test`.
The script automatically download models and checks there MD5 hashs.

Use the following command line to encode an image:

```
activate jpeg_ai_vm
python -m src.reco.coders.encoder <IMAGE_PATH> <OUTPUT_STREAM_PATH> [--set_target_bpp <TARGET_BPPm100>] [--cfg <CFG1> [<CFG2> [<CFG3> ...]]]
```

where `<IMAGE_PATH>` is a path to the input image in PNG format, `<OUTPUT_STREAM_PATH>` is a path to the output bitstream, `<TARGET_BPPm100>` is a target bit per pixel multiplied by 100. Specify a list of the configuration files of the encoding. Configuration files load one by one. In a case of running tests without any tool, the command line is: `--cfg cfg/tools_off.json cfg/profiles/<PROFILE>.json`, where `<PROFILE>` is `simple`, `main` or `high`. In a case of running tests without all tools, the command line is: `--cfg cfg/tools_on.json cfg/profiles/<PROFILE>.json`. To run test with enabling only particular tools, use the following command line: `--cfg cfg/tools_off.json cfg/tools/<TOOL1>.json [cfg/tools/<TOOL2>.json ...] cfg/profiles/<PROFILE>.json`. Where `<TOOLN>.json` is one of the files from cfg/tools directory.


Run the following command to decode the bitstream file:

```
activate jpeg_ai_vm
python -m src.reco.coders.decoder <INPUT_STREAM_PATH> <OUTPUT_PNG_IMAGE_PATH> 
```

where `<INPUT_STREAM_PATH>` is the path to the bitstream, `<OUTPUT_PNG_IMAGE_PATH>` is the path to the output PNG file.
